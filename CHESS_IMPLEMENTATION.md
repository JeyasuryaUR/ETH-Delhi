# Chess Game Implementation - ETH-Delhi Project

## 🎮 Overview

Successfully implemented a fully functional chess game system in your ETH-Delhi project with real-time multiplayer capabilities using WebSockets (Socket.IO).

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
1. **Chess Dashboard Route** (`/dashboard/chess`)
   - Interactive UI with game controls
   - Real-time connection status indicator
   - Player information display
   - Game state management

2. **Interactive Chess Board**
   - Visual chess board with piece movement
   - Click-based piece selection and movement
   - Move validation using chess.js
   - Visual feedback (highlighted squares, valid moves)
   - Support for all chess rules including castling, en passant, pawn promotion

3. **Real-time Multiplayer**
   - WebSocket-based communication (Socket.IO)
   - Player matchmaking queue system
   - Real-time move synchronization
   - Game state broadcasting

4. **Game Flow**
   - Join game queue → Match with opponent → Play game → View results
   - Automatic color assignment (random)
   - Turn-based gameplay
   - Game end detection (checkmate, stalemate, draw)

5. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Console logging for all game events
   - Detailed game scoresheet on completion
   - Winner determination and reason logging

## 📁 File Structure

### Client Side (`/client/src/`)
```
app/dashboard/chess/page.tsx         # Main chess game page
components/chess/ChessBoard.tsx      # Interactive chess board component  
hooks/useChessSocket.ts              # Socket.IO client hook
```

### Server Side (`/server/src/`)
```
app.ts                               # Main server with Socket.IO setup
socket/chessSocket.ts                # Chess game logic and socket handlers
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Game Initialization
- User connects wallet (mock implementation)
- Player data includes: `id`, `name`, `walletAddress`
- Click "Start Game" to join matchmaking queue

### 2. Matchmaking Process
- First player joins queue → Status: "Searching..."
- Second player joins → Instant match creation
- Random color assignment (white/black)
- Both players receive game details and board position

### 3. Gameplay
- Real-time move validation using chess.js library
- Visual board updates on both clients
- Turn enforcement (only current player can move)
- Check/checkmate detection
- All standard chess rules supported

### 4. Game Completion
- Automatic detection of game end conditions:
  - Checkmate
  - Stalemate  
  - Draw (insufficient material, threefold repetition)
- Complete game scoresheet logged to console
- Clean game data logging for future integration

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Socket Events

**Client → Server:**
- `join-game-queue` - Join matchmaking
- `make-move` - Submit a chess move
- `game-ended` - Manual game termination

**Server → Client:**
- `waiting-for-opponent` - Waiting in queue
- `game-found` - Match created
- `move-made` - Move broadcast to both players
- `game-completed` - Game finished
- `opponent-disconnected` - Handle disconnections
- `error` - Error messages

### Move Validation
- Server-side validation using chess.js
- Prevents illegal moves
- Handles special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
- Real-time board state synchronization

### Game State Management
- In-memory storage (ready for database integration)
- Active games tracking
- Player queue management
- Automatic cleanup after game completion

## 🎨 UI Features

### Game Controls Panel
- Connection status indicator
- Player information display
- Game state-specific interfaces:
  - Waiting: Start game button
  - Searching: Loading animation
  - Matched: Opponent details + countdown
  - Playing: Turn indicator + game info
  - Finished: Results + play again option

### Chess Board
- 8x8 interactive grid
- Unicode chess pieces (♚♛♜♝♞♟)
- Visual highlights:
  - Selected piece (yellow)
  - Valid moves (green)
  - Last move (yellow outline)
- Coordinate labels (a-h, 1-8)
- Board orientation based on player color

## 🎮 Usage Instructions

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd ETH-Delhi/server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Client  
   cd ETH-Delhi/client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the game:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/chess`
   - Mock wallet connection is automatic
   - Click "Start Game" to join queue

3. **Test multiplayer:**
   - Open two browser tabs/windows
   - Start game in both tabs
   - They will be matched automatically
   - Play chess in real-time!

## 📋 Console Logging

The system provides comprehensive console logging as requested:

### Game Events
```javascript
🎮 Starting game search...
🎯 Match found!
🚀 Game started!
📝 Move made: { from: 'e2', to: 'e4' }
```

### Game Completion Scoresheet
```javascript
🏆 GAME COMPLETED 🏆
=====================================
Winner: White
Winning Reason: Checkmate
Player 1: Player 1 ( 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678 )
Player 2: Player 2 ( 0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd )
Game ID: game_xyz123
Final Board Position: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR
Move History: ['e4', 'e5', 'Nf3', ...]
=====================================
```

## 🔮 Ready for Integration

The implementation includes handler functions with console logs for all integration points:

- **Wallet Integration**: Mock player data ready to be replaced with real wallet connection
- **Database Integration**: All game data structures ready for persistence
- **Blockchain Integration**: Game results and moves logged for smart contract integration
